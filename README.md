# Cloud Migration and Management for Alishan Bazar (Jun 2020 - Jul 2021)

## Introduction

This repository contains documentation and resources related to the cloud migration and management project for Alishan Bazar, conducted from June 2020 to July 2021. The project involved migrating the web application from a local web hosting provider to Amazon Web Services (AWS), along with configuring, optimizing, and managing the cloud infrastructure.

## Project Overview

The goal of the project was to leverage AWS cloud services to improve the performance, scalability, and reliability of the web application hosted by Alishan Bazar. The migration process involved several stages, including:

- **Assessment:** Detailed assessment of the existing infrastructure to identify migration requirements and dependencies.
- **Data Migration:** Transfer of website files, databases, and other data from the current hosting provider to AWS.
- **Application Setup:** Configuration of web servers, databases, and application dependencies on AWS.
- **Networking Connectivity:** Configuration of networking components, including VPCs, subnets, and DNS settings.
- **Security and Compliance:** Implementation of security measures and compliance standards to protect the web application and data.
- **Performance Optimization:** Strategies for optimizing the performance of the web application on AWS, including caching, CDNs, and server configurations.
- **Monitoring and Management:** Configuration of monitoring and management tools on AWS to track the performance, availability, and security of the web application.
- **Cutover and Go-Live:** Plan for the final migration cutover, including DNS updates, data synchronization, and go-live activities.

## Critical Challenges

Migrating from a web hosting provider to AWS presented several critical challenges, including:

1. **Compatibility:** Ensuring compatibility of the web application with AWS services and configurations, including operating systems, databases, and software dependencies.
   
2. **Data Transfer:** Managing the transfer of large volumes of data, including website files, databases, and media content, from the existing hosting provider to AWS while minimizing downtime and data loss.

3. **Security and Compliance:** Implementing robust security measures and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations to protect sensitive data and maintain regulatory requirements.

4. **Cost Management:** Optimizing costs associated with AWS services, including instance types, storage, data transfer, and third-party services, to ensure cost-effectiveness and budget compliance.

5. **Performance Optimization:** Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks, latency issues, and resource constraints to optimize the performance and responsiveness of the web application on AWS.

6. **Monitoring and Management:** Configuring effective monitoring and management tools to track performance metrics, detect anomalies, and ensure the availability and reliability of the web application in the AWS environment.
