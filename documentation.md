# Migration Documentation

## Introduction
This document serves as comprehensive documentation of the migration process, providing runbooks, configurations, and best practices to ensure a successful migration of the web application from the current hosting provider to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Requirements
Before initiating the migration process, ensure the following requirements are met:

- Access to AWS Management Console with appropriate permissions for provisioning resources.
- Understanding of the current web application architecture, including server configurations, databases, and dependencies.
- Access to domain registrar or DNS provider for updating DNS records.
- Backup of all website files, databases, and other data from the current hosting provider.
- Familiarity with AWS services such as EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and IAM for provisioning and configuring resources.

## Runbooks

### 1. Pre-Migration Runbook
- Verify prerequisites and requirements for the migration process.
- Perform a comprehensive assessment of the existing infrastructure and applications.
- Develop a migration plan, including timelines, resource requirements, and dependencies.
- Communicate migration plan and timelines to stakeholders and teams involved.

### 2. Data Migration Runbook
- Backup website files, databases, and other data from the current hosting provider.
- Transfer website files to Amazon S3 and configure static website hosting.
- Migrate databases to Amazon RDS and update database connection settings.
- Validate data integrity and consistency post-migration.

### 3. Application Setup Runbook
- Launch EC2 instances and configure web servers with appropriate software and settings.
- Create and configure RDS database instances with necessary parameters.
- Set up VPC, subnets, security groups, and network configurations.
- Deploy application code and configure environment variables.

### 4. Networking Connectivity Runbook
- Configure VPCs, subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.
- Implement security groups and NACLs to control network traffic.
- Set up DNS resolution, DNS hostnames, and DNS records in Route 53.
- Integrate CDN services like CloudFront for content delivery optimization.

### 5. Security and Compliance Runbook
- Implement IAM users, roles, and policies for secure access management.
- Configure encryption for data at rest and in transit using KMS and SSL/TLS.
- Enable compliance standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR as per requirements.
- Set up logging, monitoring, and auditing using CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and AWS Config.

### 6. Performance Optimization Runbook
- Implement caching mechanisms using ElastiCache, CloudFront, and CDN.
- Configure autoscaling, instance types, and sizes for optimal resource utilization.
- Fine-tune server configurations, database settings, and application performance.
- Monitor performance metrics and optimize based on insights gathered.

### 7. Monitoring and Management Runbook
- Set up CloudWatch alarms, logs, and dashboards for monitoring key metrics.
- Enable CloudTrail for tracking API activity and AWS resource changes.
- Implement AWS Config for continuous configuration monitoring and compliance.
- Utilize Trusted Advisor for automated checks and optimization recommendations.

### 8. Testing and Validation Runbook
- Conduct thorough testing of the migrated web application for functionality, performance, and security.
- Perform end-to-end testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and load testing.
- Validate DNS updates, data synchronization, and application behavior post-migration.
- Document and address any issues or discrepancies found during testing.

### 9. Cutover and Go-Live Runbook
- Coordinate DNS updates and data synchronization activities with stakeholders.
- Monitor traffic and validate functionality during the go-live process.
- Conduct post-migration reviews and document lessons learned.
- Implement performance optimizations and security enhancements as needed.

## Best Practices
- Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access permissions.
- Regularly backup data and configurations to prevent data loss and ensure recoverability.
- Automate provisioning and configuration using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK.
- Implement a disaster recovery (DR) plan and conduct regular DR drills to test recovery procedures.
- Stay updated with AWS best practices, security advisories, and compliance requirements for ongoing maintenance and optimization.

## Conclusion
By following the documented runbooks, configurations, and best practices outlined in this documentation, you can ensure a smooth and successful migration of the web application to AWS. Thorough planning, testing, and adherence to best practices are key to achieving a secure, performant, and reliable environment in the cloud.
