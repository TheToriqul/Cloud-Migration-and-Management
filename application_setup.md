# Web Application Setup on AWS

## Introduction
This document outlines the step-by-step procedures for setting up the web application environment on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This includes configuring servers, databases, and application dependencies necessary to host and run the web application.

## Server Setup

### Step 1: Launch EC2 Instances
- Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud).
- Launch EC2 instances based on your requirements, choosing the appropriate instance type, operating system (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu), and other configuration options.
- Make sure to select the desired VPC and subnet, and configure security groups to allow inbound traffic on HTTP/HTTPS ports (80/443).

### Step 2: Configure Web Servers
- Connect to your EC2 instances via SSH using SSH key pairs.
- Install and configure the web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx) on each EC2 instance.
- Set up virtual hosts or server blocks to host multiple websites or applications if needed.
- Verify that the web servers are running correctly and serving web pages.

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Create RDS Database Instance
- Navigate to RDS (Relational Database Service) in the AWS Management Console.
- Choose the appropriate database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and click "Create database".
- Configure the database instance settings, including instance type, storage, database name, username, and password.
- Ensure that the database instance is launched in the same VPC as your EC2 instances for network connectivity.

### Step 2: Connect Application to Database
- Update your web application's configuration files to point to the RDS database endpoint.
- Replace the existing database host, username, password, and database name with the corresponding values for your RDS instance.
- Test the database connection to ensure that the web application can communicate with the RDS database.

## Application Dependencies

### Step 1: Install Required Software
- Install any necessary software dependencies for your web application, such as programming language runtimes (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js), libraries, and frameworks.
- Use package managers like apt, yum, or pip to install software packages on the EC2 instances.

### Step 2: Configure Application Environment
- Set up environment variables and configuration files for your web application.
- Configure application settings such as database connection details, API keys, and other environment-specific configurations.

### Step 3: Deploy Application Code
- Upload your web application code to the EC2 instances using SCP, SFTP, or version control systems like Git.
- Ensure that the application code is placed in the appropriate directory and has the necessary permissions to be executed by the web server.

### Step 4: Start Application Services
- Start the web server and any other application services required for your web application to function properly.
- Monitor the application logs for any errors or issues during startup.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can set up the web application environment on AWS, including configuring servers, databases, and application dependencies. Make sure to test your web application thoroughly to ensure that it is working as expected in the AWS environment before making it available to users.
