# Cutover and Go-Live Plan

## Introduction
This document outlines the plan for the final migration cutover, including DNS updates, data synchronization, and go-live activities, to ensure a smooth transition from the current environment to the migrated web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Pre-Cutover Preparation

### Step 1: Finalize Migration Tasks
- Ensure that all migration tasks, including data migration, application setup, and testing, have been completed successfully.
- Verify that the web application is fully functional, performs as expected, and meets security requirements.

### Step 2: Review Rollback Plan
- Review the rollback plan and ensure that mechanisms are in place to revert to the previous environment in case of any issues during the cutover process.
- Validate that backups of critical data and configurations are available for rollback purposes.

## Cutover Activities

### Step 1: DNS Updates
- Coordinate with the domain registrar or DNS provider to update DNS records to point to the new AWS resources.
- Modify the DNS settings to route traffic from the domain name to the newly migrated web application hosted on AWS.
- Set appropriate TTL (Time to Live) values for DNS records to minimize DNS propagation time.

### Step 2: Data Synchronization
- Perform a final data synchronization to ensure that all data changes made during the migration process are replicated to the new environment.
- Verify data consistency and integrity between the old and new environments before proceeding with the cutover.

### Step 3: Application Configuration
- Update application configuration files or environment variables to reflect any changes in the new AWS environment (e.g., database connection settings, API endpoints).
- Validate that the application can connect to the updated database instance and other AWS services without any issues.

## Go-Live Activities

### Step 1: Monitor Traffic
- Monitor incoming traffic to the web application to ensure that DNS updates have propagated successfully and users are accessing the new environment.
- Use CloudWatch metrics, access logs, and monitoring tools to track performance, availability, and security metrics during the go-live process.

### Step 2: Validate Functionality
- Conduct thorough testing of the migrated web application to ensure that all features and functionalities are working as expected in the AWS environment.
- Perform end-to-end testing, including user acceptance testing (UAT), to validate the application's behavior under real-world conditions.

### Step 3: Post-Migration Verification
- Verify that all data, configurations, and settings have been migrated accurately to the new environment.
- Validate that the web application is responsive, performs well, and meets performance benchmarks defined during testing.

## Post-Cutover Activities

### Step 1: Review Performance
- Monitor the performance of the migrated web application post-cutover and identify any performance bottlenecks or optimization opportunities.
- Take proactive measures to optimize resource utilization, improve scalability, and enhance user experience based on performance insights.

### Step 2: Conduct Post-Migration Review
- Conduct a post-migration review with stakeholders to gather feedback, address any issues or concerns, and document lessons learned for future migrations.
- Document the cutover process, including any challenges faced, resolutions implemented, and recommendations for improvement.

## Conclusion
By following the cutover and go-live plan outlined in this document, you can ensure a smooth and successful transition from the current environment to the migrated web application on AWS. Effective coordination, thorough testing, and proactive monitoring are essential for minimizing downtime, mitigating risks, and delivering a seamless user experience during the cutover process.
