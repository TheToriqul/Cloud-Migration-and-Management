# Data Migration to AWS

## Introduction
This document outlines the procedures for transferring website files, databases, and other data from the current web hosting provider to Amazon Web Services (AWS) as part of the migration process.

## Website Files Migration

### Step 1: Backup Website Files
- Connect to the current web hosting provider's server via FTP, SSH, or file manager.
- Create a backup of all website files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets.
- Compress the backup files into a single archive for easier transfer.

### Step 2: Upload Files to Amazon S3
- Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Amazon S3.
- Create a new S3 bucket to store the website files.
- Upload the compressed backup archive to the newly created S3 bucket.
- Set appropriate permissions on the S3 bucket to allow public access if necessary.

### Step 3: Configure Static Website Hosting
- Enable static website hosting for the S3 bucket.
- Configure the index document and error document settings as needed.
- Obtain the endpoint URL for the static website hosted on S3.

### Step 4: Update DNS Records
- Log in to the domain registrar or DNS provider's dashboard.
- Update the DNS records to point to the S3 static website endpoint.
- Verify DNS propagation to ensure the website is accessible via the updated domain.

## Database Migration

### Step 1: Backup Database
- Access the current web hosting provider's database management interface (e.g., phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench).
- Export a backup of the database in a suitable format (e.g., SQL dump, CSV).

### Step 2: Create Database on AWS
- Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the RDS service.
- Choose the appropriate database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a new database instance.
- Configure the instance settings, including instance type, storage, and security settings.

### Step 3: Restore Database Backup
- Once the database instance is created, access the database management interface (e.g., AWS RDS Console, MySQL Workbench).
- Import the database backup file into the newly created database instance.

### Step 4: Update Database Connection Settings
- Update the database connection settings in the website code or configuration files to point to the AWS RDS database endpoint.
- Ensure that the necessary firewall rules and security groups are configured to allow inbound connections to the database instance.

## Other Data Migration Considerations

- **Emails**: If email services are hosted with the current provider, migrate email accounts and settings to AWS WorkMail or another email service provider.
- **Logs and Backups**: Transfer server logs, backup files, and other essential data to appropriate AWS services (e.g., Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3 Glacier).

## Conclusion
By following the outlined procedures, website files, databases, and other data can be successfully migrated from the current web hosting provider to AWS. Careful planning and execution are crucial to ensure a smooth transition with minimal downtime and data loss.
